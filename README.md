# Similarity-Analysis-of-SARS-CoV-2-Genomes-Using-IBSI
A bioinformatics project that calculates the Information-Based Similarity Index (IBSI) between four SARS-CoV-2 genomes from different countries using k-mer distribution and rank correlation (RÂ²). It measures genetic similarity and evolutionary relationships, supporting genomic tracking and vaccine research.
